# Image Encryption Tool

## Overview

The **Image Encryption Tool** is a Python-based application that secures image files through pixel manipulation techniques. Users can encrypt and decrypt images using operations such as pixel swapping and basic mathematical transformations, ensuring that their images remain private and protected.

## Features

- **Pixel Manipulation**: Utilizes random pixel swaps and mathematical operations (e.g., XOR) to obscure image content.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Tkinter, providing an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for easy image selection.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Allows users to encrypt images into a secure format and decrypt them back to their original form using a provided key.
- **Flexible Key Input**: Accepts an integer key for encryption and decryption processes, enhancing security.
- **Supports Common Formats**: Works with popular image formats like PNG, JPG, and JPEG.
